# Password-Generator
In this week homework, we create an application that generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. The user needs to choose what types they are prefer to use (special charactors, upper case charactors, lower case charactors, numeric charactors). If their prefer types are less than 2, we will keep alert until we get at least 2 different types they prefer to use in their password. And also the user needs to decide the password length by themself. the length of password must be 8 to 128.
